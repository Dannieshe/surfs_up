- There is a higher average temperature in June than December, which is expected.
- Both months maintain very similar temps on average(75 degrees in June and 71 degrees in December).
- Though their average temps are similar, the min temperatures are seperated by 8 degrees(64 degrees in June and 56 degrees in December).

## Summary

Based on the above stats, the temperature in Oahu from June to December is typicaly mild. With the data provided we can see that this would be an optimal location for the ice cream / surf shop. I would reccomend that the other winter months be analyzed to see how long the 70 degree trend holds. We may also want to check the amount of precepitation during these same times to make sure that rain wont be a reason for a big  loss of sales.
